                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-teal-dark mt-12 mb-6">What Makes Speech Therapy in Park City Unique?</h2>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Park City isn't just any community—it's a vibrant mountain town where families balance active outdoor lifestyles with academic excellence. Our unique environment presents both advantages and considerations for speech therapy:
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-dark mt-8 mb-4">The Mountain Community Advantage</h3>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Park City families tend to be highly engaged in their children's education and well-being. The tight-knit nature of Summit County means speech therapists can collaborate closely with local schools, pediatricians, and other specialists to create comprehensive care plans.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Additionally, Park City's emphasis on active living provides natural opportunities to reinforce speech and language skills—whether it's narrating a ski run, discussing trail observations on a hike, or building vocabulary during farmers market visits.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-dark mt-8 mb-4">Considerations for Busy Families</h3>

                <p class="mb-6">
